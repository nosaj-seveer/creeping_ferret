# üéØ Advanced XSS Scanner with Multi-Crawler Integration

A comprehensive Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability scanner that combines multiple web crawling tools with advanced scanning capabilities. This tool integrates **Katana** and **ParamSpider** for maximum URL discovery coverage, then performs targeted XSS testing with customizable attack vectors.

## üåü Features

### üï∑Ô∏è Multi-Crawler Support
- **Katana Integration**: Fast, modern web crawler for active discovery
- **ParamSpider Integration**: Archive-based parameter discovery from Wayback Machine
- **Flexible Execution**: Choose individual crawlers or combine both for maximum coverage
- **Smart Deduplication**: Automatically removes duplicate URLs across crawlers

### üéØ Advanced XSS Testing
- **Cookie-Based Attacks**: Target specific cookies with `-attackcookie` flag
- **Parameter-Specific Testing**: Focus on specific GET parameters with `-param` flag
- **WAF Detection & Bypass**: Built-in Web Application Firewall detection
- **Multi-threaded Scanning**: Configurable thread count for performance optimization
- **Custom Headers Support**: Add custom HTTP headers for authenticated testing

### üîß User Experience
- **Interactive Prompts**: Step-by-step guidance with continue/stop options
- **Multiple Verbosity Levels**: Silent, Verbose, and Debug modes
- **Color-Coded Output**: Easy-to-read results with visual indicators
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time scanning progress and statistics
- **Automated Cleanup**: Optional cleanup of temporary files

## üìã Prerequisites

### Required Tools
```bash
# Install Katana
go install github.com/projectdiscovery/katana/cmd/katana@latest

# Install ParamSpider
pip3 install paramspider
# OR from source:
git clone https://github.com/devanshbatham/ParamSpider
cd ParamSpider
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Required Files
- `main.py` - Your XSS scanner script (must be in the same directory)
- `crawl_and_scan.sh` - This enhanced crawler script

## üöÄ Installation

1. **Clone or download the script:**
```bash
wget https://your-repo/crawl_and_scan.sh
chmod +x crawl_and_scan.sh
```

2. **Ensure your XSS scanner (`main.py`) is in the same directory:**
```bash
ls -la
# Should show: crawl_and_scan.sh main.py
```

3. **Verify tool installations:**
```bash
katana -version
paramspider --help
```

## üí° Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
# Interactive mode (recommended for beginners)
./crawl_and_scan.sh

# Verbose mode with target URL
./crawl_and_scan.sh 1 https://example.com

# Silent mode for automation
./crawl_and_scan.sh 0 https://example.com
```

### Verbosity Levels
- **0** - Silent mode (minimal output, good for automation)
- **1** - Verbose mode (default, interactive prompts)
- **2** - Debug mode (detailed logging and troubleshooting)

### Crawler Options

#### 1. Katana Only (Fast Active Crawling)
- Best for: Modern SPAs, JavaScript-heavy sites
- Speed: Fast
- Coverage: Current site structure

#### 2. ParamSpider Only (Archive-Based Discovery)
- Best for: Historical parameter discovery
- Speed: Medium
- Coverage: Archived URLs with parameters

#### 3. Both Crawlers (Recommended)
- Best for: Maximum coverage
- Speed: Slower but comprehensive
- Coverage: Current + historical URLs

#### 4. ParamSpider First, Then Katana
- Best for: Parameter-focused testing
- Speed: Medium
- Coverage: Archives first, then current structure

## üîß Advanced Configuration

### XSS Scanner Options

#### Basic Scan
```bash
# Choose option 1 in interactive mode
# Simple XSS testing with default payloads
```

#### WAF Detection
```bash
# Choose option 2 in interactive mode
# Includes Web Application Firewall detection and bypass attempts
```

#### Custom Threading
```bash
# Choose option 3 in interactive mode
# Specify number of threads (1-10) for performance tuning
```

#### Advanced Attack Options
```bash
# Choose option 4 in interactive mode
# Configure cookie attacks, parameter targeting, WAF detection, and threading
```

#### Full Custom Configuration
```bash
# Choose option 5 in interactive mode
# Manual command-line options configuration
```

### Cookie-Based Attacks
Target specific cookies for XSS testing:
```bash
# During advanced configuration, specify:
Cookie name: session_id
# This adds: -attackcookie "session_id" to the scanner
```

### Parameter-Specific Testing
Focus on specific GET parameters:
```bash
# During advanced configuration, specify:
Parameter name: search
# This adds: -param "search" to the scanner
```

## üìä Output Files

The script generates several output files for analysis:

| File | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `katana.txt` | URLs discovered by Katana | Katana crawler |
| `paramspider.txt` | URLs discovered by ParamSpider | ParamSpider |
| `combined.txt` | Merged and deduplicated URLs | Both crawlers |
| `final_urls.txt` | Filtered URLs with parameters | Combined results |
| `xss.txt` | Vulnerable URLs found | XSS scanner |
| `results/` | ParamSpider detailed results | ParamSpider output |

## üìà Example Workflow

### 1. Interactive Scan
```bash
./crawl_and_scan.sh 1
```
1. Enter target URL: `https://example.com`
2. Choose crawler: `3` (Both Katana + ParamSpider)
3. Configure Katana depth: `2`
4. Configure ParamSpider options: (press Enter for defaults)
5. Choose scan type: `4` (Advanced options)
6. Configure cookie attack: `session_id`
7. Configure parameter attack: `search`
8. Enable WAF detection: `y`
9. Set threads: `5`
10. Review configuration and start scan

### 2. Automated Scan
```bash
./crawl_and_scan.sh 0 https://example.com
```
- Runs silently with default options
- Uses both crawlers
- Basic XSS scanning
- Minimal output

### 3. Debug Mode
```bash
./crawl_and_scan.sh 2 https://example.com
```
- Detailed logging
- Full command output
- Troubleshooting information

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Ethical Usage
- Only test applications you own or have explicit permission to test
- Obtain proper authorization before scanning
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
- Respect rate limits and server resources

### Rate Limiting
- Use appropriate thread counts to avoid overwhelming targets
- Consider using delays between requests for sensitive targets
- Monitor server responses for rate limiting indicators

### Legal Compliance
- Ensure compliance with local laws and regulations
- Obtain written permission for penetration testing
- Document all testing activities
- Follow your organization's security testing policies

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Tool Not Found
```bash
Error: katana is not installed or not in PATH
```
**Solution:** Install missing tools using the installation commands above.

#### No URLs Found
```bash
No URLs found by katana. Check your target URL and try again.
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify the target URL is accessible
- Check if the site requires authentication
- Try increasing crawl depth
- Use ParamSpider for archived URLs

#### Scanner Fails
```bash
XSS scan failed with exit code: 1
```
**Solutions:**
- Check if `main.py` exists and is executable
- Verify Python dependencies are installed
- Review scanner command-line arguments
- Check file permissions

#### Permission Denied
```bash
Permission denied: ./crawl_and_scan.sh
```
**Solution:**
```bash
chmod +x crawl_and_scan.sh
```

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for detailed troubleshooting:
```bash
./crawl_and_scan.sh 2 https://example.com
```

## üìù Customization

### Adding New Crawlers
To integrate additional crawlers, modify the script:

1. Add crawler detection in the tool check section
2. Create a new crawler function (e.g., `run_newcrawler_scan()`)
3. Add crawler option in the selection menu
4. Update the result combination logic

### Custom XSS Payloads
Modify your `main.py` scanner to include:
- Custom XSS payload lists
- Advanced encoding techniques
- Context-aware payload selection
- Custom validation patterns

### Integration with CI/CD
For automated security testing:

```bash
# Create a wrapper script
#!/bin/bash
./crawl_and_scan.sh 0 $TARGET_URL
if [ -s xss.txt ]; then
    echo "XSS vulnerabilities found!"
    exit 1
fi
echo "No XSS vulnerabilities detected."
exit 0
```
